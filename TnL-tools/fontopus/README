This folder contains fontopus, a replacement for glf2jft.

It currently outputs a .png file containing all glyphs of a particular font
face. It also outputs a descriptive .font file with all information necessary
to extract the glyphs and render text to the screen.

Fontopus was developed a long time ago but has not been integrated into
Thunder&Lightning yet. TnL is still lacking the capability of reading .font
files and the author thinks about alternatively introducing freetype loading
capability directly into TnL.
