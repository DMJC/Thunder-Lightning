| Modeltool |
-------------

This folder contains the "modeltool" which reads 3d models in Wavefront .obj
format plus an additional .spec file. It then outputs a .bounds file with
geometry for the collision detector and another .obj file in which every object
has been moved so that it's pivot point lies on the origin. This .obj will be
read by Thunder&Lightning for objects which contain hierarchical transforms
(e.g. Tank->Turret->Cannon).

The two subtools to do the work are:
 - Skeletopus, which reads a spec file and output the .obj with translated
   objects.
 - Makebounds, which creates a .bounds collision geometry from an .obj file
   using arguments given on the command line.

The only tool normally visible for the user is modeltool.


---------
| Usage |
---------

Modeltool's command-line syntax is very simple. Just type:
modeltool SPECFILE
And it will output files as defined in SPECFILE


--------------
| Spec files |
--------------
Spec files are very important in that they're read by three different programs:
 - modeltool
 - skeletopus and
 - Thunder&Lightning itself.
Spec files define a hierarchy between the objects in a wavefront .obj file.
They also contain coordinates for pivot points and special points with some
meaning inside the game.

There are examples for .spec files in TnL's share/tnl/models directory.
