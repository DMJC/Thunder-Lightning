This folder contains glf2jft, the tool currently used to create fonts for
Thunder&Lightning.

It is based on glFont by Brad Fish.
http://students.cs.byu.edu/~bfish/glfont.php

The idea is to use glFont to create a .glf file with glFont and convert it
to TnL's jft (an imaginary abbreviation of JoFont, guess what that means)
format with glf2jft.

---------
| Usage |
---------

glf2jft - Convert font data in glf format into jft format.
Usage: glf2jft <glf-file> <jft-file> <spr-file>
Where
  <glf-file> is the glFont file that contains the original font data.
  <jft-file> is the JoFont file that you want to produce.
  <spr-file> is the font sprite that contains the glyphs.
